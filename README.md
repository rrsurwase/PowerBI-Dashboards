# PowerBI-Dashboards
you have been commissioned by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to create a dashboard.

It needs to show the improving road safety over the time period 2007-2018 by state. The target the NHTSA has is 1.02 fatalities per 100,000,000 miles driven.

To assist you, please use the spreadsheet "PA - Driving Safety" from the workbook "PowerBIData". The spreadsheet has:

The state, year, miles traveled and actual fatalities,

The actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles.

The target level of fatalities, and

The actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles in the last year of the data, 2018.

This dashboard should have the following features:

1. A slicer in which you need to select a state. (Hint: In "Selection controls", select "Single Select" to On).

2. A card which shows the state selected.

3. A gauge which shows the 2018 actual fatalities per 100,000,000 miles.

The gauge show go from 0 to 2.5, and should have a target of 1.02.

The color of the gauge should be conditional on the value - blue if 0.8, yellow if 1.02, and red if 2.50.

4. A map, showing the state selected. The color of this filled map should be the same as the gauge.

5. A KPI which has the indicator as Fatalities, the Trend Axis as Year, and the Target goal being the Average of Target Fatalities. (You should use: "Decreasing is positive" and "Low is good".)

6. Two cards, which show the total Miles driven, and the number of fatalities.

You should also create 3 additional charts on three separate pages:

1. A bar chart of fatalities over time. Use conditional formatting to vary the color of the bar.

2. A bar chart showing number of miles driven, and

3. A line and clustered column chart showing the fatality rate (as bars) and the number 1.02 as a Line value.
